# FindAndGo
A Leaflet plugin to find a service or equipment near some place, and the route to get there.
<p>
The purpose of this plugin is mostly to demonstrate how open data and free services can be used to provide a nice interactive map. 
This fetches live OpenStreetMap data which is accessed through the Overpass API, geocoding and reverse geocoding using the french national address database (aka BAN for "Base Adressse Nationale")
Routing is using Graphhopper's API.

Next task is to document it, meanwhile you can see it in action (and in french) here : http://dev.cartocite.fr/FindAndGo/.
