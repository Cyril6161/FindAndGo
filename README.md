# FindAndGo
A Leaflet plugin to find a service or equipment near some place, and the route to get there.
<p>
The purpose of this plugin is mostly to demonstrate how open data and free services can be used to provide a nice interactive map. 
This fetches live OpenStreetMap data through the Overpass API, uses the geocoding API provided by the french national address database (aka BAN for "Base Adressse Nationale"),
and Graphhopper's routing API. I hope you find it useful and inspiring.

Next task is to document it, meanwhile you can see it in action (and in french) here : http://dev.cartocite.fr/FindAndGo/.
